# Sams Serif

A recursive font rendering framework, complete with a font. Sam's Serif is hosted at https://sams-serif.markasoftware.com/.

## Building

Clone the repo, `npm install` from the repo, then `npm run build` to bundle scripts. `npm run watch` will automatically run `npm run build` every time a file changes, given that the `entr` utility is installed.

## Testing

`npm test` will run the Tape-based test suite. You should use `standard` to verify and potentially fix style issues.
